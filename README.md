The importance of a website is an inherently subjective issue that depends on the interests, knowledge and attitude of the reader. However, much can still be said objectively about the relative importance of websites. This article describes PageRank, a method of objectively and mechanically evaluating web pages that effectively measures people's interest and attention to them.
